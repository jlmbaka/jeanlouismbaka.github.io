  Hey there!
</p>



My name is Jean-Louis Mbaka. I am Computer Scientist and Software Engineer. I currently work as a Systems/Network Administrator and IT Manager.

This will be a blog about my technical interests and adventures, and the projects I undertake and the interesting things I learn about along the way.

I have a keen interest in Software Development, Machine Learning and Deep Learning especially in the context of Visual Recognition/Computer Vision. I am currently following Stanford's [CS231N](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) course on Convolutional Neural Networks using Python.

I have a Masters in Computer Science from the University of Bath in the UK.

Since I started learning [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) last year, I have taken a liking to Systems Programming. As a result, I have implemented two simple virtual machines in Rust, both of which are hosted on GitHub. I am in the midst of implementing an assembler in Rust, which translates assembly (mnemonics) into binary machine code for a toy platform named [Hack](http://www.nand2tetris.org/).

Between all that, there will be other projects that will not necessarily fall within the aforementioned areas but will be pursued as topics catch my interest or as needs arise.

In the future, I will strive to write at least one blog post for each project that I undertake and publish on my [GitHub](https://github.com/jlmbaka).


## Projects

You can find the projects I am working on and the Open Source repositories I have contributed to on my [GitHub](https://github.com/jlmbaka).


## Languages

These days, I mainly code in Python and Java. I also work with (in order of proficiency) C#, Rust, MATLAB, C, C++, SQL.


## Hobbies

I also have other hobbies besides programming, including photography, drawing, and reading.


I hope you enjoy my blog.
