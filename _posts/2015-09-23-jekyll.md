title: How I created my first blog powered by Jekyll, Github, and Lanyon
---

### Forewords

<!-- Situations -->
I have finally decided to make the big jump and start a blog. Years ago, I created a [Wordpress](http://jeanlouismbaka.wordpress.com) blog but I ended up never posting anything on it. I will take the plunge for real this time, head first.

This will be a blog about my technical interests and adventures, and my projects. More about this blog can be found on the [About page](/about/).


### Introduction

<!-- Tasks -->
In this post, I will be walking you through the steps that I took to get my first blog running. It is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator. I did not want to start from scratch so I used [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), a [Poole](http://getpoole.com) based template to quickly hit the ground running. I will be hosting this blog on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) which was the natural choice for me because I host the majority of my development projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/jlmbaka).

### Before You Get Started
In order to complete this journey, we will need a GitHub account and some basic knownledge of how GitHub works. However if you have no prior knowledge of GitHub, it is easy to [sign up](https://github.com/join) and GitHub provides an [extensive documentention on getting started](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git).

### Create a GitHub Repository

I begun my journey by creating a new Git repository with the name `<username>.github.io` where `<username>` is your GitHub username. It is important that `<username>` in the repository name above matches your actual username, otherwise GitHub Pages will not work.

Since my username is jlmbaka, the repository I created is `jlmbaka.github.io`.

```	
https://github.com/jlmbaka/jlmbaka.github.io.git
```

### Download and install the required software

The next step was to install and get Jekyll working on my PC. Below are the steps I followed to download and install Jekyll and its requirements on my Windows 8 machine.

#### Ruby
Download and install ruby from [rubyinstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/).

#### Ruby Development Kit

Download and unpack Ruby DevKit from [rubyinstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) into your choosen directory.

Open a Command prompt with Ruby, then navigate to the directory in which you unpacked the DevKit at the previous step (I unpacked mine in `C:\RubyDevKit`) and run the following two commands one after the other to install the DevKit:

```console
$ ruby dk.rb init
$ ruby dk.rb install
```

#### Bundler

Bundler is a package manager for Ruby. It eases the pain of installing Ruby software. Install Bundler by running the following command from the ruby command line:

```console
$ gem install bundler
```

### Jekyll

In your site root directory (I named mine `jlmbaka.github.io` after the name of my repository), create a file called `GemFile` and add the following lines to it:

```Ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'github-pages'
```

After that, simply run `bundle install` to launch the installation process. This might take a while to finish, therefore be patient. Once the command returns, you can verify that Jekyll was installed correctly by running the following command (it checks the version of your installation):

```console
$ jekyll --version
```

#### Poole

Download [poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) or [lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) templates from their respective GitHub repository and unpack the files into your root directory.


### Run Jekyll

Open a console, `cd` into your root directory, and run the following command:

```console
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Make sure that your system path is configured with Python 2. I ran into an error `Failed to get header. (MentosError)` when I first tried to run the following command with Python 3.4 as my default installation. I switched to python 2.7.6 and it worked perfectly. Keep the avove in mind, it will save you from the frustration I had to go through until I found a solution.

By default, Jekyll will serve the site at the following address [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/). Open a browser and navigate the link.


### Customisations

I applied the following modifications to my blog in order to get it to its current form:

#### Archive Page

I added an archive page to the side bar of my blog. This page dynamically generates a lists all of posts on the website. I followed the instructions of [Joshua Lande](joshualande.com) to achieve this.

You just need to create a file `archive.md` in your root directory and paste the  code below into it. This gets automatically picked up and added by Jekyll into the side bar.

```liquid
{% raw %}
---
layout: page
title: Archive
---

## Blog Posts

{% for post in site.posts %}
* {{post.date | date_to_string}} &raquo; [{{post.title}}y]({{post.url}})
{% endfor %}
{% endraw %}
```

#### Google Analytics

I also enabled [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics) on my blog. This was pretty easy. Just sign up to Google Analytics and register your website. At the end of the process, you will obtain a tracking code to be embedded in your website.


```html
<script>
  (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
  (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
  m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
  })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');

  ga('create', 'UA-64732940-1', 'auto');
  ga('send', 'pageview');
</script>
```

Save the code above in the file `_includes/google_analytics.html` and modify the file `_layouts/default.html` to include the following line:

```html
{% raw %}
{% include google_analytics.html %}
{% endraw %}
```

Doing so adds the tracking code on each page of your site.


#### Disqus Comments

Next I added Disqus comments to my site. I registered with (Disqus)[www.disqus.com] and then signed up for their Engage platform in order to obtain the Universal Code to embedded into the website.

```html
{% if page.comments %}
<div id="disqus_thread"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
    /* * * CONFIGURATION VARIABLES * * */
    var disqus_shortname = 'jlmbaka';
    
    /* * * DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE * * */
    (function() {
        var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true;
        dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js';
        (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);
    })();
</script>
<noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript" rel="nofollow">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript>
{% endif %}
```

I saved the code above in the file `_includes\disqus_comments.html` and added the following line where you want it the comments to appear to the file `_layouts\default.html`. In order to enable comments on a given post, add `comments: True` to the YAML Front Matter. More on this (here)[https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472138-jekyll-installation-instructions].:

```html
{% include disqus_comments.html %}
```

### Push the blog to GitHub Pages

I concluded by publishing my blog to the web using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host the site. The commands I typed on the console from the root directory of the website to push my repository to GitHub are as follow:

```console
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/jlmbaka/jlmbaka.github.io.git
$ git pull origin master
$ git push -u origin master
```

That's it, we now have a Jekyll powered blog hosted on GitHub Pages.
